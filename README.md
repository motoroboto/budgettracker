A simple Budget tracking Progressive Web App. It utilizes a Mongo database and a service worker that allows for offline updates to the database. The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.

Offline Functionality:

  * Enter deposits offline

  * Enter expenses offline

When brought back online:

  * Offline entries should be added to tracker.

You can view the deployed app on [Heroku](https://motorobotobudgetracker.herokuapp.com/).
